# Zilllla.github.io

For this project, I utilised HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, in addition to an API- omdbapi.
Really, my site is rather simple. I definitely tried to stick to things I am comfortable with, as opposed to trying out all of these grandeous ideas and screwing myself over in the end. I had several problems trying to auto-populate the information from the API in the boxes. I also had a significant amount of difficulty assigning the photos to the api address; I'm certain there's an easier, less repetitious way to pair the image with the info from the api.  

If afforded more time (I actually plan on coming back to this on my own time), I would have liked to have added a local film showtime portion to the page.
