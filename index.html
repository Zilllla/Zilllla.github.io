    <h1>Zilla's Cult and Trash Favourites</h1>

    <p>Looking to dive into the weirder, esoteric, arthouse and, dare I say, somewhat shitty world of cult and trash cinema? Well, you're in the right place! From the strangest corners of the film world, to the refined and intentional art, the goal of this site is to assist you in finding the perfect werido film to watch next. If you're unsure as to where to start, allow me to provide a run-down, albeit brief, of the genres available. <br><br><a href="bHorror.html">B-Horror</a>: These are the worst of the best in terrible gore effects, pure cheese, not to mention the acting (for lack of a better word).<br><br><a href="noExp.html">No Explaination</a>: These films, at least in my mind, don't really fit into a succinct category. From the uncomfortable world of John Waters to the can-I-get-away-with-this work of Richard Elfman, you'll find a wonderfully terrible weird time here.<br><br><a href="jodorowsky.html">Jodorowsky</a>: Unlike the other segments of this site, this segment is devoted entirely to the director Alejandro Jodorowsky- a Chilean-French avant-garde surrealist filmmaker.
